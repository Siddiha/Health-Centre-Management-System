# 🏥 Health Centre Management System

A comprehensive system for managing health centre operations, patient records, and appointments.

Empowering healthcare providers with efficient tools for better patient care.

## About

The Health Centre System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the operations of a health centre. It aims to provide a centralized platform for managing patient records, scheduling appointments, tracking medical history, and generating reports. This system addresses the challenges faced by healthcare providers in maintaining accurate records, optimizing workflows, and delivering efficient patient care.

The target audience for this system includes doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and health centre managers. By leveraging Java's robust features and scalability, the Health Centre System offers a reliable and efficient solution for managing healthcare operations. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy customization and integration with other healthcare systems.

Key technologies used in this project include Java, a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), and potentially a Java framework (e.g., Spring, JavaFX) for building the user interface. The architecture is designed to be multi-tiered, with a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
